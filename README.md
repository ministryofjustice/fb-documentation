## Run locally

You'll need [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed to get this project running.

Note: You will need the [active LTS (Long-term support)](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) Node.js version for this project (as specified in [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc))

### Fork repository (optional)
If you're an external contributor make sure to [fork this project first](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

### Clone repository
```
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/fb-documentation.git # or clone your own fork

cd fb-documentation
```

### Using nvm (optional)
If you work across multiple Node.js projects there's a good chance they require different Node.js and npm versions.

To enable this we use [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to switch between versions easily.

1. [install nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)
2. Run `nvm install` in the project directory (this will use [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc))

### Install npm dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Start a local server
This will build sources, serve pages and watch for changes.
```
npm start
```

## Build
Build `./src` to `./deploy/public`
```
npm run build
```

## Run the Sass linter

We are using the [sass-lint][sass-lint] plugin to lint the Sass files in
`source/stylesheets`. You can run the linter from command line by running:

```
npm run lint
```

## GOV.UK Frontend packages

Form Builder consumes [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) packages via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
These are defined in the [package.json](package.json) file.

That requires NPM login credentials provided by GDS.

---------------------
**NOTE:**
For the time being we are consuming private packages. To access private packages, you will first need to log in to NPM with

`npm login`
