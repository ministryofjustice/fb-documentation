## When to use this component

You must always show an error summary when there is a validation error with the information that a user has entered, even if there’s only one.

## How it works

You must:

- show an error summary at the top of a page
- include a heading to alert the user to the error
- link to each of the problematic questions

Additionally, you should reflect that there has been an error in the `<title>` by prefixing the existing title with `“Error:”`. This will make sure that screen readers are alerted to errors as soon as possible.

You must also show an [error message](../error-message) alongside the specific input or inputs which have errors.

There are 2 ways to use the Error summary component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit-beta.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.
