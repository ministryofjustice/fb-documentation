Avoid unnecessary decoration. Only use images if thereâ€™s a real user need.

## Aspect ratio

### Photography

The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

{{ example({group: 'styles', item: 'images', example: 'default', html: false, open: false}) }}


### Illustrations or representative imagery

If your image represents something physical, such as a letter, document or credit card you should use the aspect ratio of that item.

{{ example({group: 'styles', item: 'images', example: 'representative', html: false, open: false}) }}

## Alt text

All images must have an alt tag. You should include a description of the image inside the tag to help users who are unable to see it.

{{ example({group: 'styles', item: 'images', example: 'alt-text', html: true, open: true}) }}

If your image is purely decorative and a description would be confusing you should still include the alt tag, but leave it empty so it will be ignored by screen readers.
